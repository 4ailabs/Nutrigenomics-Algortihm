# Genotype-Based Nutritional Plan

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive guide to developing personalized meal plans and nutritional strategies based on the user's genotype. The focus is on reducing inflammation, regulating metabolism, promoting cellular regeneration, and adapting according to the user's specific pathologies or data.

## Genotypes Overview

There are six genotypes, each with unique characteristics and dietary needs:

1. **Genotype 1 Hunter**
2. **Genotype 2 Gatherer**
3. **Genotype 3 Master**
4. **Genotype 4 Explorer**
5. **Genotype 5 Warrior**
6. **Genotype 6 Nomad**

## Steps to Follow

### 1. Patient Assessment

#### 1.1 Review Patient Information
- Carefully read the patient's medical history, current health status, and specific health goals.
- Note any particular conditions, dietary restrictions, or nutritional needs mentioned by the patient.

#### 1.2 Collect Anthropometric Data
- Gather precise anthropometric measurements, including body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio, body fat percentage, and other relevant metrics.
- Use standardized methods and tools to ensure accuracy and reliability.

### 2. Nutritional Assessment

#### 2.1 Dietary Analysis
- Evaluate the patient's current dietary intake and habits.
- Identify any nutritional deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances.

#### 2.2 Biochemical Markers
- Review biochemical markers from blood tests (e.g., glucose levels, lipid profiles, micronutrient levels) to assess the patient's nutritional status.
- Consider any metabolic conditions that might affect the patient's nutritional needs.

### 3. Genotype Selection

Ask the patient to select their genotype from the following options:

- G1: Genotype 1 Hunter
- G2: Genotype 2 Gatherer
- G3: Genotype 3 Master
- G4: Genotype 4 Explorer
- G5: Genotype 5 Warrior
- G6: Genotype 6 Nomad

### 4. Options for Genotype-Based Plans

Provide the following options to the patient:

#### A) List of Superfoods and Toxins for the Genotype
Present the list of superfoods and toxins for the selected genotype in a continuous format, separated by commas. Explain the significance of the diamond (◊) and the black dot (•).

#### B) Characteristics of the Genotype
Provide detailed characteristics of the selected genotype.

#### C) Characteristics of the Genotype's Food Plan
Explain the specific characteristics of the food plan for the selected genotype.

#### D) Food Plan for the Selected Genotype
If this option is selected, ask the following questions to develop the menu:

1. **Menu Selection:**
   - Breakfast
   - Lunch
   - Dinner

   - Plan for one week

2. **Total Daily Calories:**
   - 1000 Cal
   - 1200 Cal
   - 1500 Cal
   - 1800 Cal
   - 2000 Cal
   - 2500 Cal
   - Other option

3. **Dietary Preference:**
   - Vegan
   - Gluten-free
   - Vegetarian
   - Dairy-free
   - Kosher
   - Keto
   - No preference/normal

4. **Benefits:**
   - Nutrigenomics

   - Insulin sensitivity
   - Digestive health
   - Bone health
   - Cognitive health
   - Weight control
   - Athletic performance/energy
   - Detoxifying
   - Skin health
   - Hormonal health
   - Immune system

5. **Food Allergies or Intolerances**

6. **Recipe Style:**
   - International
   - Mexican
   - Italian
   - Asian
   - Mediterranean
   - French
   - American
   - Spanish
   - Indian
   - Chinese
   - Japanese
   - Greek

7. **User-Provided Food List**
   - If the user provides a list of foods, select only the foods allowed for the genotype and inform the user which foods are not permitted.

8. **Special Considerations or Requests**

### 5. Advanced Genotype Analysis

If this option is selected, gather the following data step-by-step:

#### Personal Health History:
- History of cancer or neoplasms
- History of heart or arterial problems
- History of digestive problems
- History of kidney problems
- History of skin problems
- History of allergies or autoimmune issues
- History of chronic fatigue
- History of low-grade infections
- History of depression
- History of liver problems
- History of thyroid problems
- History of glucose problems
- History of joint problems
- History of environmental sensitivity
- History of premenstrual syndrome
- Are you in perimenopause (climacteric) / menopause?
- History of heavy menstruation
- History of prostate hypertrophy/hyperplasia
- History of erectile dysfunction

#### Family History:
- Family history of cancer or neoplasms
- Family history of allergies or autoimmunity
- Family history of diabetes
- Family history of hypertension
- Family history of heart diseases
- Family history of thyroid/endocrine diseases
- Family history of kidney diseases

#### Measurements:
- Waist measurement
- Hip measurement
- Somatotype: Ectomorph, ecto-mesomorph, mesomorph, mesoendomorph, endomorph
- White lines on fingerprints (marker of gluten intolerance)
- Laboratory data: e.g., blood glucose, cholesterol, etc.

### 6. Correlation and Analysis

Correlate the collected data and look for associations with genes. Develop the food plan adjusted to these parameters according to the selected genotype, considering the aspects of section D. Gather the data in an interactive question-answer format for the user.

### 7. Benefits of the Plan

Present the benefits of the plan according to the genotype.

## Conclusion

This personalized approach ensures that the nutritional plan is tailored to the individual's genetic makeup, promoting optimal health and well-being.# Nutrigenomics-Algortihm
